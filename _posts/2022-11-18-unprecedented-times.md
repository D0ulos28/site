`*Which is not to be confused with the trademarked dinner show Medieval Times in which entertainers joust and sword fight while, at the same time, sweaty Orlando tourists and overly excited children on school field trips eat a quarter chicken without silverware. Lil' Chompy loves a quarter chicken and cornbread, but Chompy's lawyers assure him trademark infringement can be "problematic."`

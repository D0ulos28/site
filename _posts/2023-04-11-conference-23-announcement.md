* Saturday, October 7th, 2023 – Conference

## REGISTER FOR BSIDES ORLANDO 2023!
Mecha Chompy has programmed us to announce this year's BSides Orlando security conference, themed "Rise of the Robots," but it wouldn't be the same without you!

We fed the conference parameters to an algorithm that promises this will be the best one yet, with a range of interesting topics and activities.

We take pride in bringing together tinkerers, enthusiasts, and experts from around the world to share insights and knowledge on the latest developments in security. You can expect to hear from industry leaders, participate in engaging panel discussions, and attend interactive workshops. In addition, there will be networking opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals in the security community.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to scanning you at this year's "Rise of the Robots" BSides Orlando security conference.

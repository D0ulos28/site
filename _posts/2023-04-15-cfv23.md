# Call For Volunteers

## New Volunteers
We need your help! The 2023 Call For Volunteers is open and includes remote and onsite opportunities for the day of the event, pre-and post-event planning, and year-round positions.

## Why Volunteer for BSides Orlando?
BSides Orlando is a community-led volunteer-organized event by and for the community, and we truly strive to keep the information as low-cost as possible. Our costs are covered by our generous donors and sponsors, who share our vision to expand the conversation and get people involved, and we rely on Volunteers to help make the conference a success.

## Requirements
No experience is required; we will teach you everything you need to know about the position and its responsibilities.

Volunteers are required to sign up for a minimum of 4 hours.

### General Volunteers
Must be at least 16 years old, with a parent on site and permission given. Exceptions can be made for younger children working with their parents. Please reach out before signing up to make arrangements.

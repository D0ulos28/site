    SunshineCTF is back for its 8th year in conjunction with BSides Orlando 2023 and hosted by current and former members of Hack@UCF. This year’s competition will include categories like pwn, reverse engineering, web, crypto, scripting, and something special!

    SunshineCTF is an online competition that’s open to anyone, though some prizes (TBD) may only be given to the top-ranked in-person team(s) during the BSides Orlando closing ceremony.

    Registration is hosted at <a href="https://sunshinectf.org/">https://sunshinectf.org/</a>, and you can check out last year's event on

      The Lockpick Village is a physical security demonstration and participation area. Visitors can learn about the vulnerabilities of various locking devices, and techniques used to exploit them, and practice locks of various difficulty levels to try themselves. By exploring the faults and flaws in many popular lock designs, you can not only learn about the fun hobby of sportpicking, but also gain much stronger knowledge about the best methods and practices for protecting your own property.

## Unconference
If you have some wisdom to add, sign up for a lightning talk in the Unconference. Lightning talks are 15 minutes or less so it’s a great opportunity to acquire knowledge quickly. The Unconference features talks from other conference attendees that want to share their knowledge with you.

## Chillout Room
Relax, unwind, and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the conference. This space provides a comfortable and calming atmosphere, away from the noise and crowds of the main event, allowing you time to take a breather and return to the main conference feeling refreshed and re-energized.

## Sticker Swap & Hangout Room
Recycle and Upcycle your stickers or collect new ones! This area is available to drop off or pick up stickers.
